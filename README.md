# Quarterly-Assessment-2
Creating a functional database that houses and displays review quizzes for my classes this semester [Assisted by ChatGPT 3.5].
The file titled 'QA2Create.py' is the creation of the database and 5 different tables that hold the 5 quizzes.
The next file, titled 'QA2Populate.py', houses the code that fills out the tables with values that will be used for the quizzes including the quiz numbers, questions, and answers.
The file 'QA2Pull_Tables.py' visualizes the names of the tables for users.
